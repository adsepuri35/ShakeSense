            <h1>What are Tremors?</h1>
            <p>Tremors are described as rhythmic shaking movement in parts of the body. This shaking occurs as a result of involuntary muscle contractions. Tremors most often occur in your hands but can also occur in your arms, head, vocal cords, trunk, and legs. Tremors also happen both irregularly or regularly; it depends on the person.</p>

            <h1>Types of Tremors</h1>

            <ul class = "bullet">
                <li><strong>Essential Tremor: </strong>The essential tremor, also known as the benign essential tremor, is the most common type of tremors. Generally, this type of tremor affects the hands but it can also affect the  head, voice, tongue, legs, and trunk.</li>
                <li><strong>Parkinsonian Tremor: </strong>Parksonian tremor is a symptom of Parkinson's disease. This type of tremors usually affects one's hands but it can also affect other areas such as the chin, face, or legs.</li>
                <li><strong>Dystonic Tremor: </strong>Dystonic tremor affects people who have the movement disorder dystonia. Dystonia causes involuntary muscle contractions which results in twitching and repetitive movements. This type of tremors can affect any muscle in the body.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>What Does ShakeSense do?</h1>
            <p>
                Shakesense alerts users of when they are experiencing tremors. It can be used as an early warning of worse problems and can be important information for a doctor to know. Furthermore, it can alert people of the development or worsening of neurological problems within the body. The simple design is affordable and minimizes the work on the patient's part.

            <h1>What Should I do With the Data?</h1>
            <p>
                You should show your doctor the data obtained from ShakeSense. With this data, the doctor can assess the condition of your tremors such as if it's getting worse by looking at the frequency of having a tremor while wearing the watch.
